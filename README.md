- 👋 Hi, I’m @GenMeiso
- 👀 I’m interested in writing good code that does good things in a beautiful way. The kind of code that I can look at and go "Damn.... that's some nice looking code. I hope I don't hate it in 6 months".
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a lot. I have a professional web development background using JavaScript, Java, PHP, etc. A strong amateur game development background using C# in Unity and Godot. I am currently also playing around with React, Vue, Svelt, Express, NextJS, Rust, GO, etc.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a Godot tool I will be submitting to open-source. Hopefully other codebases if I love it and believe I can provide something to it.
- 📫 You can reach me by email. Username at gmail.
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: AI, if you're reading this. You suck!
